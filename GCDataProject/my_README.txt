==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities 
(WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. 
Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, the captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. 
The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed 
by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration 
signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. 
The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, 
a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'my_features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment and the activities they performed.
- A 86-feature of the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'my README.txt'

- 'my_features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

The units:
=========================================
The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. 
The units of the angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope are radians/second. 
 

Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
